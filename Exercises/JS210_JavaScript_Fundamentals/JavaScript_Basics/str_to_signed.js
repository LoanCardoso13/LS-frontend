/*

  The previous exercise mimics the parseInt function to a lesser extent. In this exercise, you're going to extend that function to work with signed numbers.

  Write a function that takes a string of digits and returns the appropriate number as an integer. The string may have a leading + or - sign; if the first character is a +, your function should return a positive number; if it is a -, your function should return a negative number. If there is no sign, return a positive number.

  You may assume the string will always contain a valid number.

  Examples:

  stringToSignedInteger('4321');      // 4321
  stringToSignedInteger('-570');      // -570
  stringToSignedInteger('+100');      // 100
