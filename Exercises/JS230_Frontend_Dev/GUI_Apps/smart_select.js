Problem with car filtering
The car filtering application that we developed in the previous exercise works fine, but it has a small problem. When we select a car make from the filtering options, the model selection options remain the same. Ideally, selecting a specific make should limit the possible model choices to cars made by that manufacturer.

Required change
Make the changes needed in the car filtering application so that selecting a make restricts the model choices to the manufacturer's models.
