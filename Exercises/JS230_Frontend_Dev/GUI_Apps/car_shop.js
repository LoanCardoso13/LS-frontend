Create an application that shows a grid of cars from a collection of cars. Users can filter the cars by make, model, price and year of manufacture.

Specifications
Display the following information for each car:

* an image
* make and model
* price
* year manufactured

The page should have a filtering area that contains the following:

* A select box for car makes. Populate the options by selecting all the unique makes from our car collection
* A select box for car models. Populate the options by selecting all the unique car models from our car collection
* A select box for years. Populate the options by selecting all the unique years from our car collection
* A select box for price. Populate the options by selecting all the unique prices from our car collection
* A filter button
* When the user clicks the filter button, filter the cars so that the cars displayed all have the same price, model, make and manufacture year as the selected values.

You can start with any collection of cars. Below is the collection used in our demo app.

const cars = [
  { make: 'Honda', image: 'images/honda-accord-2005.jpg', model: 'Accord', year: 2005, price: 7000 },
  { make: 'Honda', image: 'images/honda-accord-2008.jpg', model: 'Accord', year: 2008, price: 11000 },
  { make: 'Toyota', image: 'images/toyota-camry-2009.jpg', model: 'Camry', year: 2009, price: 12500 },
  { make: 'Toyota', image: 'images/toyota-corrolla-2016.jpg', model: 'Corolla', year: 2016, price: 15000 },
  { make: 'Suzuki', image: 'images/suzuki-swift-2014.jpg', model: 'Swift', year: 2014, price: 9000 },
  { make: 'Audi', image: 'images/audi-a4-2013.jpg', model: 'A4', year: 2013, price: 25000 },
