/*

Implement the markup and JavaScript for booking a schedule. Be sure to check out the documentation on the requirements for a booking.

In the event that the student who's booking the appointment isn't in the database, you must provide a way for the user to create the student, and then automatically proceed with the booking once the student is successfully created.

Assume that only one schedule at a time can be booked.

Note that page load may take a while when there are more than 7 schedules to retrieve. Recall the assigment on "Getting Schedules." It's up to you if you want to add code to handle this situation.
