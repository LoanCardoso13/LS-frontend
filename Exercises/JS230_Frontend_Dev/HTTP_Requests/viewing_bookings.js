/*

Implement the markup and JavaScript to view bookings made by students. The view for bookings should have two levels of detail. The first level shows only a list of dates that have bookings. The second level becomes visible only when a date is clicked and shows a nested list of booking details for the data. Details include the staff name, student email address, and the time booked.
