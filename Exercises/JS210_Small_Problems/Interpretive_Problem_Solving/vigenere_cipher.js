  The Vigenere Cipher encrypts alphabetic text using polyalphabetic substitution. It uses a series of Caesar Ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. Each letter of the keyword is treated as a shift value. For instance, the letter 'B' corresponds to a shift value of 1, and the letter 'd' corresponds to a shift value of 3. In other words, the shift value used for a letter is equal to its index value in the alphabet. This means that the letters 'a'-'z' are equivalent to the numbers 0-25. The uppercase letters 'A'-'Z' are also equivalent to 0-25.

  Applying the Vigenere Cipher is done sequentially for each character by applying the current shift value to a Caesar Cipher for that particular character. To make this more concrete, let's look at the following example:

  plaintext: Pineapples don't go on pizzas!
  keyword: meat

  Applying the Vigenere Cipher for each alphabetic character:
  plaintext : Pine appl esdo ntgo onpi zzas
  shift     : meat meat meat meat meat meat
  ciphertext: Bmnx mtpe qwdh zxgh arpb ldal

  result: Bmnxmtpeqw dhz'x gh ar pbldal!

  Notice that in the example, the key isn't moved forward if the character isn't in the alphabet. Like the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenere Cipher only encrypts alphabetic characters.

  Write a function that implements the Vigenere Cipher. The case of the keyword doesn't matterâ€”in other words, the resulting encryption won't change depending on the case of the keyword's letters (e.g., 'MEat' === 'mEaT').

  For a quick lookup of a ciphertext per character, you may consult this tabula recta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_recta). Each row of the table corresponds to a Caesar Cipher encryption using the columns' character letter as a shift value.
