/*

In an earlier exercise, we created a school object. It works, however, it can still be improved. The following are improvements for you to implement in the solution provided:

Make the list students private. Right now, anyone can gain access to it and manipulate it.
Make the constraint for allowed values for years a private variable. As a private variable it avoids an unnecessary statement in the addStudent method and at the same time makes the code more declarative.
Make the getCourse function accessible in the addGrade method also. As it is, only the courseReport method has access.
If you need a refresher on creating private data and scope, you may find the following lessons helpful:

1) Creating a Private Scope with an IIFE
2) Creating Private Data with an IIFE
